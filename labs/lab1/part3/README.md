# Part 3 - Divide
Write a function which divides a 64-bit unsigned number with a 31-bit unsigned number.  The 31-bit divisor is guaranteed to be a power of 2.  The program should take in the 64-bit as 2 32-bit numbers: first the upper 32 bits, then the lower 32 bits.  
            The answer should be printed out as 2 32-bit numbers.  Do not worry if the output of your program is a negative number.  PCSPIM prints out numbers as signed numbers, so if one of the answers happens to have a leading 1, the number will appear as negative.  Here are some test cases (shown as dividend high 32, dividend low 32 / divisor = quotient high 32, quotient low 32): 1,1 / 65536 = 0,65536 and 2,10 / 65536 = 0,131072 and 42,32 / 32 = 1,1342177281 and 210,64 / 64 = 3, 1207959553. Name your file divide.asm. Program 3 only needs to work with positive numbers.
