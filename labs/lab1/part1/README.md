# Part 1 - Mod
Write the following fast "mod" function.  This function uses no modulus operator, multiplication, or division - it uses only basic arithmetic/logical operations (add, sub, and...).  The function takes two integers as inputs - a number (num), and a divisor (div).  You are guaranteed that div is a power of 2.  You want the remainder of num / div.  For example, if num=22 (00010110 in binary) and div = 4 (100) would return 2 (10). Your algorithm should *not* repeatedly subtract (or add) div from num. Name your file mod.asm.  Program 1 only needs to work with positive numbers.
