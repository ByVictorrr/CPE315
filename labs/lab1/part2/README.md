# Part 2 - Reverse
Write a program which prints the number that represents reverse-ordered binary of the input number. This means the your program will print the 32-bit number that is generated if the 32-bit input number's bits are written in reverse order (MSB becomes LSB and so on).  Name your file reverse.asm. Program 2 only needs to work with positive numbers as input.
